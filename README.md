# portfolio

## Description

The reason behind making this project was to make a website that I can use as my own personal portfolio throughout my career.

I would like to use it and improve upon it further so that businesses have an easy way to learn more about me, see my previous projects, contact me easier and also gain access to my resume easier. 

Creating this website gives access to all these things in the one place using a very easy to use and view design layout.

I learned a lot creating this website, it helped improve my HTML and CSS skills drastically and taught me about tonnes of new features that I didn't know of and helped me improve upon features that I already did know of.

## Usage

Using the website is quite simple, a description will be provided of how to do so.
